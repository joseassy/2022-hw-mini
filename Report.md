  In this Mini project, we aimed to change the code of the Pico Microcontroller such that the LED on it would fade at a desired rate. We decided that we wanted to just slow the fade going up whilst keeping the fade going down constant. This resulted in a slow start, with the LED slowly brightening up before quickly fading down and starting again. Video 115 shows the original, unmodified code to fade the led on the pico board. A quick look at the time shows us that it takes roughly 1.5 seconds from when the led just lights up to when it is fully lit and eventually fades down until it is off. We also take take note that the time it takes for the led fade up is the same as the time it takes for the led to fade down. This is because the increments of the --fade and ++fade are the same (one increment). 

  In our modified version of the led fading, we tweak the increments of the fading led. We each had our own idea of doing so by changing the amount to 0.2 instead of 1. Jose decided to change the increment to fade += 0.2 while Stanley decide to simply subtract 0.8 from fade for the same result of a net incremental increase of 0.2. In our final code, we decided to implement Jose's version. We can see in video 605 that the fade up time has increased. The increment is much smaller and so the fade will much slower. Fade down time has been kept exactly the same at one increment per line execution. This bumps up the total cycle time to around 2-3 seconds from unlit, to fully lit, then back to unlit. We were successful in our modifications of the fade time my chaning the net incremental change of fading up. We think this is an interesting pattern of fading the led although the source code had very small changes to it.
