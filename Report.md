In this Mini project, my partner and I aimed to change the code of the Pico Microcontroller such that the LED on it would fade at a desired rate. We decided that we wanted to just slow the fade going up whilst keeping the fade going down constant. this resulted in a slow start, with the LED slowly brightening up before quickly fading down and starting again.
